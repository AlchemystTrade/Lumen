		<h1>Lumen</h1>
		<p>
			Welcome to Lumen. This is a quiet, non-commercial video library designed for focused viewing. 
			We offer a curated selection of films and recordings, organized by the time of day they are best experienced.
		</p>
		<p>
			There are no algorithms here, no recommendations, and no distractions. Just the content, as it was meant to be seen.
