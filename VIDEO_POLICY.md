# Lumen Video Policy

This document defines when and how video materials may appear in Lumen.

Lumen is a curated video library, not a streaming platform.

---

## 1. Hosting policy

Lumen does NOT host video files.

All video content must be:
- linked to an official source, or
- embedded only if explicitly permitted by license.

---

## 2. Embedding rules

Video embedding (iframe) is allowed ONLY when ALL conditions are met:

- The source explicitly allows embedding
- The license is Public Domain or Creative Commons (CC0 / CC-BY / CC-BY-SA)
- No autoplay is enabled
- No recommendations or suggested videos are displayed
- The embed does not include ads or tracking

If any condition is unclear, embedding is forbidden.

---

## 3. Link-only mode

If embedding is not allowed or unclear:

- The video is listed as a catalog entry
- A direct link to the official source is provided
- A textual description replaces playback

This is the default and preferred mode.

---

## 4. Prohibited sources

The following sources are NOT allowed under any circumstances:

- YouTube (including official channels)
- TikTok, Instagram, Facebook
- Reuploads or mirrors
- Platforms with recommendation-driven playback

---

## 5. Fragments and clips

Short clips or fragments are allowed ONLY if:
- the fragment is officially released as a standalone work
- the fragment has its own license
- full context is preserved

Random excerpts are forbidden.

---

## 6. Child-safety principle

Every video must satisfy at least one of the following:
- promotes understanding of the natural world
- explains systems or processes
- develops emotional or ethical awareness

If a video cannot be justified in these terms, it does not belong in Lumen.

---

## 7. Decision rule

When in doubt:
- do not embed
- do not include
- do not compromise

Silence and absence are preferable to noise.
