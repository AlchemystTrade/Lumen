# Offline-first policy

Lumen is designed to remain useful without continuous internet access.

- Textual content must be self-sufficient
- Videos are supplementary, not required
- All descriptions and questions must be readable offline
- Offline packages may be printed or shared for educational use

Access should never depend on connectivity.
