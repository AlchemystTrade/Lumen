# Lumen Governance

This document defines how Lumen evolves without losing its purpose.

---

## 1. Frozen principles (never change)

The following principles are permanent:

- No algorithms
- No recommendations
- No autoplay
- No comments
- No analytics or tracking
- No hosting of video files
- No commercial intent

If any of these are violated, the project is no longer Lumen.

---

## 2. What may change

The following elements may evolve carefully:

- Visual styling (colors, typography)
- Content organization
- Number of curated items
- Offline formats and exports

Changes must not introduce stimulation or engagement mechanics.

---

## 3. Content admission process

Every new video must:

- Follow the Content Contract
- Comply with Video Policy
- Have a verified source and license
- Include context and questions
- Justify its educational or emotional value

If justification is unclear, the content is rejected.

---

## 4. Decision rule

When disagreement exists:
- Default action is rejection
- Absence is preferable to inclusion

---

## 5. Release philosophy

Lumen does not follow versioned releases.
Updates are silent, incremental, and intentional.

No announcements. No growth targets.

---

## 6. Custodianship

Lumen is maintained by curators, not managers.
Authority comes from restraint, not expansion.
