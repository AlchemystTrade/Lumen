# Lumen Content Rules

To maintain the integrity of Lumen as a quiet, focused library for observation and reflection, all content must adhere to these invariant rules.

## Core Invariants
- **No Autoplay**: Content must never start playing without explicit user intent.
- **No Recommendations**: The interface must not suggest "what to watch next" based on algorithms.
- **No Hype**: Titles and descriptions must be factual and calm. Avoid clickbait or sensationalism.
- **No Clips without Context**: Videos must be presented as complete objects of observation with sufficient background information.

## Mandatory Components
Every video entry in the library **must** include:
1. **Context**: What is being shown, where it came from, and why it matters.
2. **Time Alignment**: A specific recommendation for the time of day it is best experienced.
3. **Reflection Layer**: At least three questions designed to encourage active observation and critical thinking.
4. **Legal Sourcing**: Clear attribution and verification of Public Domain or non-commercial licensing.

## Aesthetic Constraints
- Use neutral, stable imagery.
- Avoid videos with aggressive editing, sudden loud noises, or high-velocity transitions.
- Prioritize works that allow the viewer to "enter" the scene.
