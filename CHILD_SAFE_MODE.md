# Child-Safe Mode

Child-Safe Mode defines how Lumen prevents accidental exposure, over-stimulation, and uncontrolled navigation.

---

## 1. External navigation

- No automatic redirects
- No inline autoplay
- External links are explicit and labeled
- External links open in a new tab (`target="_blank"`)

---

## 2. Text-first default

- All content is readable without video playback
- Video is optional, never required
- Descriptions and questions precede any media

---

## 3. No infinite navigation

- No pagination loops
- No “next video” or “you may also like”
- Navigation is always manual and intentional

---

## 4. Reduced stimulation

- No animations
- No sound on load
- No visual emphasis designed to attract clicks

---

## 5. Parent-led mode

Lumen assumes an adult initiates navigation. 
Children consume content, not explore the catalog freely.

---

## 6. Absence principle

If a safety decision is uncertain, the feature is not included.

Silence is safer than stimulation.
